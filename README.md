# TagRace

Welcome to the Git of TagRace (Android), the interactive QR-Code based 'game'.

In fact it will just be a scanner with public key decryption and a history,

plus a generator which will support several types of data and public key encryption, maybe it will be possible to split content across multiple tags in the future.

So all you need is your smartphone and your printer (maybe some glue/strips).

It's my first Android/Java project ever, so pls don't kill for errors.

Any suggestions/recommendations to ein.normaler.nutzer@gmail.com please!
