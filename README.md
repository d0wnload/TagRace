# TagRace

Welcome to the Git of TagRace (Android), the interactive QR-Code based 'game'.


In fact it will just be a scanner with public key en/decryption and a history,

plus a generator which might be able to split messages across several tags.

So all you need is your smartphone and you printer (maybe some glue/strips).

Any suggestions/recommendations to ein.normaler.nutzer@gmail.com please!
